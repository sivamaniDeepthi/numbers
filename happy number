What is a Happy Number?
A Happy Number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the squares of its digits, repeatedly.

If the process ends in 1, the number is happy.
If it loops endlessly in a cycle without reaching 1, it's not a happy number.

19 → 1² + 9² = 1 + 81 = 82  
82 → 8² + 2² = 64 + 4 = 68  
68 → 6² + 8² = 36 + 64 = 100  
100 → 1² + 0² + 0² = 1
✅ So, 19 is a Happy Number


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    // Write C++ code here
    int n,p;
    cin>>n;
   
    for(int i=0; i<100;i++){
        int s=0;
        int temp=n;
    while(temp>0){
        p=temp%10;
        s=s+(p*p);
        temp=temp/10;
    } 
        if(s==1){
            cout<<"happy";
            return 0;
        }
        n=s;
    }
    cout<<"not";
    return 0;
}
